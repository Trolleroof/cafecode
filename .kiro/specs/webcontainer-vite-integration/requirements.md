# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature replaces the existing terminal and file system components with WebContainer-based implementations that provide a complete in-browser development environment. The goal is to create a universal development platform that works with any project type (Vite.js, Next.js, React, Node.js, etc.) while providing enhanced functionality through WebContainer's browser-based runtime. This integration will include modern UI components for both the terminal and file explorer, making the development experience seamless and visually appealing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a WebContainer-based terminal that replaces the current terminal implementation, so that I can run any development commands directly in the browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the terminal tab that is to the right of the editor THEN the system SHALL initialize a WebContainer instance with a full Linux-like environment
2. WHEN a user types commands THEN the system SHALL execute them in the WebContainer and display real-time output
3. WHEN the terminal starts THEN the system SHALL provide a modern, visually appealing interface with proper theming
4. IF WebContainer initialization fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a WebContainer-based file system that replaces the current file explorer, so that I can manage files efficiently with a modern interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the file explorer THEN the system SHALL display files from the WebContainer file system
2. WHEN a user creates, deletes, or modifies files THEN the changes SHALL be reflected in both the WebContainer and the UI immediately
3. WHEN the file explorer loads THEN the system SHALL provide a modern, tree-view interface with icons and proper styling
4. IF file operations fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and allow retry

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time preview capabilities for web applications, so that I can see changes immediately as I develop.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a development server starts (any framework) THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the preview URL and port
2. WHEN the preview URL is available THEN the system SHALL display a preview panel or banner with the application
3. WHEN files are modified THEN the system SHALL support hot reloading and live updates automatically
4. WHEN preview updates occur THEN the system SHALL maintain the preview state and handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced terminal commands for any project type, so that I can perform common development tasks efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens a terminal THEN the system SHALL provide framework-specific commands based on the detected project type
2. WHEN a user runs "auto-start" THEN the system SHALL detect the project type and start the appropriate development server
3. WHEN a user runs framework-specific build commands THEN the system SHALL execute the build process and display results
4. WHEN commands are run THEN the system SHALL provide helpful suggestions and error messages for any project type

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to efficiently synchronize between WebContainer file system and the backend, so that file operations are fast and reliable across all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are modified in WebContainer THEN the changes SHALL be synchronized with the backend file system
2. WHEN the backend serves file trees THEN it SHALL integrate with WebContainer's file system for real-time updates
3. WHEN detecting project configurations THEN the system SHALL recognize config files for any framework type
4. WHEN managing multiple projects THEN the system SHALL track project metadata (ports, build status, framework type) efficiently


### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want WebContainer integration to handle build processes for any project type, so that I can create production builds in the browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs build commands THEN the system SHALL execute the appropriate build process in WebContainer
2. WHEN builds complete THEN the system SHALL display build statistics, output location, and file sizes
3. WHEN build errors occur THEN the system SHALL display detailed error information with file locations and suggestions
4. IF builds succeed THEN the system SHALL optionally offer to preview the production build or provide download options

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modern, visually appealing UI components for the terminal and file explorer, so that I have an excellent development experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the terminal THEN the interface SHALL provide modern styling with themes, syntax highlighting, and smooth animations
2. WHEN using the file explorer THEN the interface SHALL display proper file icons, folder structures, and intuitive navigation
3. WHEN interacting with either component THEN the UI SHALL provide responsive feedback and loading states
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display them with clear, well-designed error messages and recovery options

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration between the WebContainer file system, terminal, and editor, so that all components work together harmoniously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are saved in the editor THEN the changes SHALL be immediately reflected in the WebContainer file system
2. WHEN files are modified through the terminal THEN the file explorer SHALL update automatically
3. WHEN development servers are running THEN file changes SHALL trigger appropriate hot reloading or rebuilds
4. IF synchronization issues occur THEN the system SHALL detect and resolve conflicts automatically or prompt the user
