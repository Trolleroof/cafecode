i am on low internet and am struggling to use cursor's functionalities, so obey the following rules. 

    Never rewrite or regenerate whole files or unrelated sections.

    Always highlight the exact lines or code block being changed before applying edits.

    Always prompt the user to confirm the selection and intended change before proceeding.

    Show a preview of the diff that includes only the precise code being edited.

    Do not make any changes outside the chosen section, no matter what the edit request is.

    Focus all automated movements, suggestions, and edits on just the targeted area, ignoring all other parts of the file.

    Never apply broad or file-wide suggestions when connection is poor.

    Dont overthink it, and BE QUICK.
